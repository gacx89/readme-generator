# README Generator

## Description
This repository hosts a Node.js application that after prompting a user for various information, generates a markdown file to act as a README for the user's project.

## Usage
After launching the application via the terminal by typing `node index`, you will be prompted with a list of prompts. Enter the information you wish to add to your project's README file. After you get a message stating that the README has been generated, you will find a README.md in the `./dist` folder.
